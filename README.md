# webtools

A lightweight collection of tools and links contained in a single HTML file!

To run this locally, a simple method is using a Node.js web server:

```shell
npm install http-server -g
cd www
http-server
```

For deployment, simply copy the contents of the `www` directory to any HTTP web server and access it using your browser.
